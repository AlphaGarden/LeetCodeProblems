# LeetCodeProblems
#These are leetcode problems from Python 2.7
<h2>Hello, Everyone</h2>
<p>My name is alpha garden. I am working on the leetcode problems now.</P>
<p>In these challenges, I will attach my thoughts and conclusions to the problems.</p>
<p>Because I just started to practice my ability to solve the algorithm problems,</p>
<p>And I really appreciated that you could adjust my solutions.</p>
<p>Some solutions are referenced from leetcode, but I do my own explanation to it</P>
